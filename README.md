# FoldingNet: Point Cloud Auto-encoder via Deep Grid Deformation

This is an implementation for FoldingNet in PyTorch. FoldingNet is a autoencoder for point cloud. As for the details of the paper, please reference on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07262).

## Environment

* Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
* Python 3.8
* CUDA 10.1
* PyTorch 1.7.1

## TODO

When train the model with the chamfer distance with the given code, `nan` appeared. I'm looking for a good implementation for the extend chamfer distance.
